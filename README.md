# [Heimdall-Lite](https://github.com/mitre/inspec/heimdall-lite/)

A small but powerful single page JavaScript implementation of the MITRE Heimdall InSpec results viewer.

# Installation & Use

As a single-page javascript app - you can run [Heimdall-Lite](https://github.com/mitre/inspec/heimdall-lite/) from any webserver, a *secured* s3 bucket or directly via GitHub Pages (as it is here). [Heimdall-Lite](https://github.com/mitre/inspec/heimdall-lite/) gives you the ability to easily review and produce reports about your inspec run, filter the resuls for easy review and hot-wash, print out reports, generate System Security Plan (SSP) content, and much more.  

## Heimdall vs Heimdall-Lite

There two versions of the MITRE Heimdall Viewer - the full [Heimdall](https://github.com/mitre/inspec/heimdall/) and the [Heimdall-Lite](https://github.com/mitre/inspec/heimdall-lite/)  version. We produced each to meet different needs and use-cases.
